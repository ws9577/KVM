# Step 1: Create a Large LVM Logical Volume as a Storage Pool
# Create the LVM Volume: Decide on the size of the storage pool, then create a logical volume. For example, to create a 500GB LVM volume named vm-pool:
sudo lvcreate -L 500G -n vm-pool ubuntu-vg

# This will create an LVM logical volume at /dev/ubuntu-vg/vm-pool.
# Format the Logical Volume with a Filesystem: Format the volume with a filesystem (e.g., ext4) to hold qcow2 images.
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/ubuntu-vg/vm-pool

# Mount the Storage Pool: Create a directory to mount this logical volume and mount it:
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm-pool
sudo mount /dev/ubuntu-vg/vm-pool /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm-pool

# To make this mount persistent across reboots, add it to /etc/fstab:
echo "/dev/ubuntu-vg/vm-pool /var/lib/libvirt/images/vm-pool ext4 defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab


# Step 2: Configure the Pool in virt-manager
# Create a New Storage Pool in virt-manager:
        Open virt-manager.
        Go to Edit > Connection Details > Storage.
        Click + to add a new storage pool.
        Name the pool (e.g., LVM_QCOW2_Pool) and set Type to dir.
        For the Target Path, use the directory you created (/var/lib/libvirt/images/vm-pool).
        Click Finish to create the storage pool.

# Set Up Storage for Each VM Using qcow2:
        When creating a new VM, select Custom Storage.
        In the storage pool dropdown, select LVM_QCOW2_Pool.
        Allocate a .qcow2 disk image with the desired initial size (e.g., 10GB for an initially small VM).
        qcow2 files will automatically expand up to their maximum allocated size as needed.

# Step 3: Verify and Start the VM

    Confirm the configuration and finish creating the VM.
    Start the VM from virt-manager.

Each VMâ€™s disk will be a .qcow2 image within the LVM-backed pool, allowing dynamic resizing. The LVM volume itself will only fill up as each VM uses its allocated space, making this approach space-efficient.
